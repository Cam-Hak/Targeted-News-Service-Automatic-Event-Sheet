# Targeted-News-Service-Automatic-Event-Sheet

This program is based off of what I do for the website Targeted News Service. I scrape event information off websites and put it in a google sheet in a certain format. This script allows me to paste website information into the cmd prompt when ran, and it automatically opens an excel spreadsheet with the information formatted. From here all I have to do is copy and paste the cell into the shared google sheet.

In order for it to work, you need to first install openpyxl by pasting a command in the terminal:
pip install --user openpyxl

Also this program is made for a Mac.
